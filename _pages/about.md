I am a Post-doctoral researcher at DESY Zeuthen, Germany. The field of my research is High Energy Physics which deals with particles having energy in the range of GeV and above. In high-energy physics, currently, I am working on neutrino oscillations using the IceCube experiment which is located deep inside the antarctic ice at the south pole. 

In the past, I was a research scholar at the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO), where I worked on physics simulation studies of neutrino oscillations using atmospheric neutrinos. I worked on exploring the physics scenarios beyond the Standard Model of particle physics using atmospheric neutrinos. I also worked on using atmospheric neutrinos as a tool to probe the internal structure of Earth, which is also called neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth. In the experimental part, I have also worked on detector response for the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs). 

In physics, I like neutrinos, simulations, astronomy, astrophysics, and quantum physics. I also like to play with electronics and circuits.
