I am a post doctoral fellow at DESY, Zeuthen, Germany. I work in the field of High-Energy particle physics. More specifically, I study the properties of neutrino using IceCube experiment. Neutrinos can change their flavor while travel and this phenomenon is called neutrino oscillations. I work on neutrino oscillations in mulit-GeV range of energies of neutrinos.
