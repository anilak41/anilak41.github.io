**Abstract:** We report on the latest measurement of atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. The DeepCore array in the central region of IceCube enables the detection and reconstruction of atmospheric neutrinos at energies as low as ~5 GeV. This energy threshold allows the measurement of muon neutrino disappearance over a wide range of baselines available for atmospheric neutrinos. The present analysis is performed using a new data sample of DeepCore, which includes significant improvements in data calibration, detector simulation, data processing, and a detailed treatment of systematic uncertainties. The observed relative fluxes of neutrino flavors as functions of their reconstructed energy and arrival directions allow us to measure the atmospheric mixing parameters, $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$
 and $\Delta m^2_{32}$. The resulting improvement in the precision measurement of both parameters with respect to our previous result makes this the most precise measurement of oscillation parameters using atmospheric neutrinos.
