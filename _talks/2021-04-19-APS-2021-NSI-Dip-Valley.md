**Abstract:** We propose a new approach to explore the neutral-current non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in atmospheric neutrino experiments using oscillation dips and valleys in reconstructed muon observables, at a detector like ICAL. We show that the non-zero value of NSI parameter  &epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub> shifts the oscillation dip locations in ùêø/ùê∏ distributions of the up/down event ratios of reconstructed &mu;<sup>-</sup> and &mu;<sup>+</sup>  in opposite directions. We introduce a new variable &Delta;d representing the difference of dip locations in &mu;<sup>-</sup> and &mu;<sup>+</sup>, which is sensitive to &epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub>, and is independent of the value of &Delta;m<sup>2</sup><sub>32</sub>. We further note that the oscillation valley in the (E, cos&theta;) plane of the reconstructed muon observables bends in the presence of NSI, its curvature having opposite signs for&mu;<sup>-</sup> and &mu;<sup>+</sup>. We illustrate how the measurement of contrast in the curvatures of valleys in &mu;<sup>-</sup> and &mu;<sup>+</sup> can be used to estimate &epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub>. Using these proposed oscillation dip and valley measurements, the achievable precision on \|&epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub>\| at 90% C.L. is about 2% with 500 kt‚ãÖyr exposure including the effects of statistical fluctuations, systematic errors, and uncertainties in oscillation parameters.
