**Abstract:** We propose a new approach to probe neutral-current non-standard neutrino interaction parameter &epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub> using the oscillation dip and oscillation valley. Using the simulated ratio of upward-going and downward-going reconstructed muon events at the upcoming ICAL detector, we demonstrate that the presence of non-zero &epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub> would result in the shift in the dip location as well as the bending of the oscillation valley. Thanks to the charge identification capability of ICAL, the opposite shifts in the locations of oscillation dips as well as the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for &mu;<sup>-</sup> and &mu;<sup>+</sup> is used to constrain \|&epsilon;<sub>&mu;&tau;</sub>\| at 90% C.L. to about 2% using 500 ktâ‹…yr exposure. Our procedure incorporates statistical fluctuations, uncertainties in oscillation parameters, and systematic errors.
