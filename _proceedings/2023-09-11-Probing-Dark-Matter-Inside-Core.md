**Abstract:** Atmospheric neutrinos, due to their multi-GeV range of energies and wide range of baselines, can probe into the possible existence of dark matter inside the core of the Earth in a unique way via Earth matter effects in neutrino oscillations. We demonstrate that an atmospheric neutrino detector such as the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory with muon charge identification capability can be sensitive to the presence of dark matter at around a $2\sigma$ confidence level with 1000 ktÂ·yr exposure if dark matter constitutes 40% of the mass inside the core. We further demonstrate that it is hard to identify the dark matter profile using neutrino oscillations, but the baryonic matter profile inside the core can be explored as a complement to the seismic measurements.
