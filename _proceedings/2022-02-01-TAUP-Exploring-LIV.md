**Abstract:** We explore the signature of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) in the Standard Model Extension framework by observing the atmospheric neutrinos and antineutrinos separately with the help of magnetized Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). Using 500 kt-yr exposure of ICAL, we place stringent bounds on the CPT-violating LIV parameters $a_{\mu\tau}$, $a_{e\mu}$, and $a_{e\tau}$ (one-at-a-time) at 95% C.L. (1 d.o.f). We demonstrate the advantages of charge identification capability and hadron energy information at ICAL while constraining these LIV parameters. We also explore interesting correlations among various LIV parameters.
