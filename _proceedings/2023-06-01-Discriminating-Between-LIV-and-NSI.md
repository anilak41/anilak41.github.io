Conference: [The Ninth Meeting on CPT and Lorentz Symmetry, (Online) 17 May - 26 May, 2022,](https://lorentz.sitehost.iu.edu/cpt22/){:target="_blank"}


**Abstract:** We investigate the possible degeneracy between the two scenarios, Lorentz violation and non-standard interactions, in the context of mass-induced neutrino oscillation. For current and upcoming fixed-baseline experiments, it is practically impossible to distinguish between these two scenarios. Here, we show how the core-passing atmospheric neutrinos can break this degeneracy. Using the Iron Calorimeter detector simulations at the India-based Neutrino Observatory, we demonstrate that such a distinction is indeed possible.
