**Abstract:** We propose a new approach to explore the neutral-current non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) in atmospheric neutrino experiments using oscillation dips and valleys in reconstructed muon observables, at a detector like ICAL that can identify the muon charge. We focus on the flavor-changing NSI parameter Œµ<sub>ŒºœÑ</sub>, which has the maximum impact on the muon survival probability in these experiments. We show that non-zero ŒµŒºœÑ shifts the oscillation dip locations in L/E distributions of the up/down event ratios of reconstructed Œº<sup>‚àí</sup> and Œº<sup>+</sup> in opposite directions. We introduce a new variable ‚àÜd representing the difference of dip locations in Œº<sup>‚àí</sup> and Œº<sup>+</sup>, which is sensitive to the magnitude as well as the sign of Œµ<sub>ŒºœÑ</sub>, and is independent of the value of Œîùëö<sup>2</sup><sub>32</sub>. We further note that the oscillation valley in the (E, cos<i>Œ∏</i>) plane of the reconstructed muon observables bends in the presence of NSI, its curvature having opposite signs for Œº<sup>‚àí</sup> and Œº<sup>+</sup>. We demonstrate the identification of NSI with this curvature, which is feasible for detectors like ICAL having excellent muon energy and direction resolutions. We illustrate how the measurement of contrast in the curvatures of valleys in Œº<sup>‚àí</sup> and Œº<sup>+</sup> can be used to estimate Œµ<sub>ŒºœÑ</sub>. Using these proposed oscillation dip and valley measurements, the achievable precision on |Œµ<sub>ŒºœÑ</sub>| at 90% C.L. is about 2% with 500 kt¬∑yr exposure. The effects of statistical fluctuations, systematic errors, and uncertainties in oscillation parameters have been incorporated using multiple sets of simulated data. Our method would provide a direct and robust measurement of Œµ<sub>ŒºœÑ</sub> in the multi-GeV energy range.
